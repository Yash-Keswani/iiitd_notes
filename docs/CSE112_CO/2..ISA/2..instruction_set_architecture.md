# Instruction Set Architecture
The ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) describes the **semantics** of all instructions supported by a processor. 

### Types of Instructions
These will be discussed during the Assembly Language section

### Desirable Features in ISA
#### Complete
The ISA is complete, and comprehensively and exhaustively capable of performing all the things we might want it to do.

#### Concise
The Instruction Set should be limited in size. It need not be *absolute minimal* (as is the case of CISC ISAs which we will see later), but it should be reasonably small (32~1000 instructions is the range of sizes we see on average)

#### Simple
These instructions have to be written by some programmers somewhere, so they should be intuitive for them.

#### Generic
Instructions such as a hypothetical `add14` are unnecessarily specialised, and bloat space in the instruction set without providing enough functionality to justify their addition.
