# Cache Structure

1) **Cache**
2) **Cache Set** - an n-way associative set with n cache blocks in it
3) **Cache Block** - contains k lines in it
4) **Cache Line** - contains l bytes in it

Consider a 32-bit machine with a set-associative cache. The total cache size is 16KB, and it is a 4-way set-associative cache. The length of the memory location is 1 byte, and the block size is 16 Bytes.
Each memory address is 32 bit long (assume).

In this scenario, the word size is 4B.
Each set has 4 blocks or 64B in it. 
Each cache block has 4 lines in it. 

The cache has 2^8 sets in it. Representing a cache set requires 8 bits.
Each cache block has 16 bytes in it. Representing a byte requires 4 bits.

Therefore, we have an addressing system that looks as such

```
|---------TAG----------|--INDEX--|--OFFSET--|
32                    12         4          0
```

First, we look for the cache set with the matching index. Then, we locate the block with the matching tag (assuming we have a cache hit). Then, we pick the address at the given offset in the block.
