# Cache Loading
### Loading
Loading is the process by which a requested value is fetched from the memory via the cache.

* A load request is issued by the processor. This memory block may or may not be present in the cache
* If it is present, this is referred to as a cache hit. If it is not, then it is called a cache miss.
* If there's a cache hit, the value is fetched directly from the cache.
* If there's a cache miss, the blcok is loaded into the cache, and the value is fetched from there.

### Cache Misses
* **Compulsory Misses** - misses that occur the first time that a memory block is loaded
* **Capacity Misses** - misses that occur because the cache is too small, and would be unavoidable even with an ideal replacement policy.
* **Conflict Misses** - misses that would've been avoidable in a situation with complete associativity

### Improving Loading Time
* A small, less associative cache leads to faster retrieval from cache hits
* A larger, more associative cache leads to less cache misses
