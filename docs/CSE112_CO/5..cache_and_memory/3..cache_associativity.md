# Cache Associativity
### Associativity
Associativity dictates how a block of memory may be loaded into a cache slot. Cache policies in ascending order of associativity are.

##### Direct Mapped
One block can only fit in one cache slot

##### n-way Set Associative
A block can fit in one of n cache slots

##### Fully Associative
Any block can fit in any cache slot


### Effect of Associativity
The more associative a cache is:

* The more time it takes to search a block within the cache.
* The less often blocks need to be replaced within the cache.
