# Memory modes sorted by Bit Density (Ascending)
#### Register
A register is a set of D-flip flops, which stores a binary value.

#### SRAM
Holds value with two diodes and two capacitors

#### DRAM
Dynamic memory, runs on the basis of a pair of capacitors

### Effect of Bit Density
The lower the bit density

* The lower the memory capacity
* The lower the memory latency
* The higher the memory bandwith

### The Memory Hierarchy

Processor -> Small Fast SRAM (Cache) -> Large Slow Memory (DRAM)
