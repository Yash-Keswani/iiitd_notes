# Write Policy
The write policy dictates how information is written into the cache and memory.

##### Hit Policy
* **Write Through** - value is written to both the cache and the memory
* **Write Back** - value is written only to the cache. However, when the block is evicted it is written to the memory.

##### Miss Policy
* **No Write Allocate** - value is written only into the memory
* **Write Allocate** - the block is brought into the cache after writing to the memory

We commonly use either write through with no write allocate, or write back with write allocate
