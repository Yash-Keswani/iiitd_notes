# Cache Timing
### Average Access Time

$$Average Mem Access Time = t_{hit} + r_{miss} * penalty_{miss} $$

### Improve Hit Time
* The smaller the cache, the better the hit time.
* The lower the associativity, the better the hit time.

However, these will greatly increase the miss rate.

### Reduce Miss Rate
* The larger the block size, the lower the miss rate. Having a _very_ big block makes movement of data too expensive to be worth though. Leads to unnecessary data movement during miss. 
	* The block size is determined more so by the data access pattern than optimising for the miss rate.
* Increasing cache size to X2 reduces miss rate by root 2 (empirical rule)
* Direct-mapped cache of size N has same miss rate as 2-way associative cache of size N/2
