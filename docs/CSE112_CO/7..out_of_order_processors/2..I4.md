### Pipeline Structure

![[Pasted image 20221021061041.png|400]]

There are three functional units here:
* ALU - X
* Memory - M
* Multiplication - Y

### Scoreboard
A scoreboard is used for issuing instructions. The architectural register files are where the information is read from / written to.

| R   | P   | F   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 0   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1  | 1   | X   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   |
| R2  | 1   | Y   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

P => Pending
F => The functional unit the register is assigned to

The numbers indicate how far the register is from being available (i.e. the writeback stage)

Bits in the data availability shift right once after every cycle.

* Stalling is done on the issue stage
* Bypass is done from writeback for instructions in Y unit
* Bypass is done from X0 for instructions in X unit
