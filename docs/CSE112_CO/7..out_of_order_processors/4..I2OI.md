### Scoreboard
I2OI uses a scoreboard for avoiding hazards while issuing instructions inorder.


### Reorder Buffer (ROB)

| State | S   | ST  | V   | PReg |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| P     | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0    |
| F     | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1    |

* **State** - Pending or Free / Finished
* **S** - Speculative
* **ST** - Store bit
* **V** - whether the physical register file is valid
* **PReg** - the physical register file specifier

The Reorder Buffer is a queue with a head and a tail. The commit stage waits for the head to be finished.

### Finished Store Buffer (FSB)

| V   | Op  | Addr | Data |
| --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| 0   | ?   | ?    | ?    |

* Only one entry is needed if one memory instruction is in flight at a time
* Single entry FSB makes allocation trivial.
* If we want to support more than one memory instruction, we need to worry about load / store address aliasing.

* r shows when a value is queued onto the reorder buffer
* C is when the new value is committed
* C and r can happen in the same cycle

### Branch Resolution
* Squash on branch resolution - more complex, especially for ROB
* Squash on branch commit
* Squash as instructions commit - more resources used, simplest

### Store Misses
Store misses add delays of ~3 cycles which is kinda bad. You can use retire stages to conduct them asynchronously while further instructions run (but you should be wary of any related hazards)
