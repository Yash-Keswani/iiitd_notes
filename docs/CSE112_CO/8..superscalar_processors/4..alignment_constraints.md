# Alignment Constraints
### Cache Lines

One cache block is placed in one cache line. Fetching instructions from two cache lines in the same cycle is very hard. Normally, we can only fetch two instructions on the same cache line. So, if two instructions are on different cache lines, the superscalar processor will fetch a nop.
