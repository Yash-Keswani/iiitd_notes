# Issue Stage

Making the bypass network for a two-way superscalar processor is _really_ complex. This network adds a significant overhead to the decode stage. For this reason, the decode stage is split into two:

* **Decode** - Parse the instruction, resolve structural hazards
* **Issue** - Read from register files, conduct bypasses, steer the instructions to the proper functional unit
