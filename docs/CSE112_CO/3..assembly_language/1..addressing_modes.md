# Addressing Modes

Addressing Modes are ways to get operands from the memory / register files.

* `Register` - ADD R4, R3, R2
* `Immediate` - ADD R4, R3, #5
* `Register Indirect` - ADD R4, R3, (R1)
* `Displacement` - ADD R4, R3, 100(R1): fetches value in the memory located at an offset of R1 from 100.
* `Memory Indirect` - ADD R4, R3, @(R1): fetches value in the memory address located at {value present in R1 address}.
* `Absolute` - ADD R4, R3, (0x475)
* `PC-Relative` - ADD R4, R3, 100(PC)
* `Scaled` - ADD R4, R3, 100(R1)\[R5\]: fetches value in the memory present R5 strides and R1 offset from 100.
