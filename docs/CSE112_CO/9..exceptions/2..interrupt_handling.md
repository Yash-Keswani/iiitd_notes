# Interrupt Handling
##### Precise Interrupt
A precise interrupt maintains the state before the interrupt before handling the exception.

Any I/O device that requests attention uses a prioritised interrupt request line.

The interrupt handler saves the Exception Program Counter (EPC) to allow nested interrupts. 

The status register indicates the cause of the interrupt. 

A special jump instruction RFE (return from exception) is used to resume code. It
* enables interrupts
* returns the processor to the user mode
* restores the hardware status and control state
