# Architecture And Organisation
### Architecture
The architecture of a computer is an analysis of the computer done by a software designer. When we think about a computer's architecture, we are concerned about how it **behaves**.

### Organisation
The organisation of a computer is how the computer is implemented in hardware. When we think about a computer's organisation, we are concerned about how its **made**.

To compare it to biology, one might say that architecture is the physiology of a computer, while organisation is its anatomy.
