# Database Architecture
The database architecture decides the way memory and disk space is utilised by the database, and can also affect how applications interact with it

#### Centralised Database
* Contains a small number of cores, executing over a shared memory
* A database running on a personal computer is a good example of this

#### Server-Style Database
* The database is located on a server. It performs work on the behalf of several client machines

#### Parallel Database
* Involves a large number of cores working over a shared memory
* Disk space is also shared between the cores

#### Distributed Database
* Involves multiple machines, which may be running at different geographic locations
* There will inevitably be heterogeneity in the schema and data. The database needs to compensate for this
