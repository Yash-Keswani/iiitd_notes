# Relational Model
All data is stored in tables

#### Example
| ID  | name | department  | salary |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| 100 | John | Physics     | 100000 |
| 125 | Doe  | Chemistry   | 98000  |
| 235 | Dane | Biology     | 90000  |
| 175 | Joe  | Mathematics | 100001 |

### Layers of Abstraction
#### Application Level
* This level is beyond the scope of management of the DBMS, but relies on it
* The application converts data from the DBMS into a human-readable format, which conceals everything irrelevant to the user

#### View Level
* A view is modified, regulated, and pre-digested access to a certain section of the database
* A view can perform data hiding for security purposes, and also hide details of datatypes

#### Logical Level
* This level describes the nature of the data shown in the database
* It also regulates the relationships between the data entities
* Lastly, it tells us about the schema, i.e. the constraints that the data columns are subject to

#### Physical Level
* The physical level decides how data is stored on the disk
* This is, understandably, something that a data analyst doesn't care much about. This decides the efficiency and effectiveness of operations and storage, but doesn't affect the behaviour of the DBMS


### Data Independence
Data independence is the ability of a lower layer of abstraction to be independent of a higher layer of abstraction. This is a very helpful paradigm, even besides the scope of database management, it is essential to the working of almost any computer program

**Logical Data Independence** - is the ability to modify the logical schema without needing to rewrite application programs

**Physical Data Independence** - is the ability to modify the physical schema without having to rewrite the logical schema
