# Database Users
#### Application Users
These will access the application program directly, with no knowledge that a database even exists. The application program will fire a query on their behalf, and use its result to give a desired output

#### Application Programmers
These will write application programs, that are used by the users. These programs are reduced by a compiler and linker to program code, and on the SQL side they are reduced to DML queries. The program code is managed by whatever language the application is written in, and the DML code is handled by SQL

#### Data Analysts
Data analysts will use DML queries directly. These are processed by the query processor, which gives them the raw output in an SQL table format

#### Database Administrators
A DBA manages the database. They have many responsibilities, notably,
* Defining schemas
* Defining the storage structure, access-methods, and physical organisation
* Checking the database for anomalies routinely
* Backing up the database routinely
* Managing and granting authorisation for database access
* Monitoring any jobs running on the database
* Ensuring that the database has enough disk space to work with
