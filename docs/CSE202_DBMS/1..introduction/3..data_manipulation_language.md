# Data Manipulation Language
Data Manipulation languages come in two flavours

### Procedural DML
Procedural DMLs require a user to specify
* What data is needed
* How the DBMS should go about acquiring this data

### Declarative DML
Declarative DMLs require a user to specify
* What data is needed
* But **not** how that data should be acquired

Example:
```SQL
SELECT name
FROM Customers
WHERE city = 'Agra' AND balance > 100000
```

* Often, complex SQL functions are embedded in some high-level language
* Application problems can access SQL via either
	* Language extensions that allow embedded SQL within the language
	* APIs (like python's `sqlite3`) that allow SQL queries to be sent to a database
