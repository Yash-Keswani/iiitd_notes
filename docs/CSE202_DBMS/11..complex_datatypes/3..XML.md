# XML
XML uses markup tags like HTML does to categorise text. Tags make teh data self-documenting, and may be hierarchical.

Note that MySQL doesn't support XML while IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, or PostgreSQL do. In MySQL, it is stored as a CLOB type.

XQuery was developed to query nested XML structures, but it's not widely used currently.
