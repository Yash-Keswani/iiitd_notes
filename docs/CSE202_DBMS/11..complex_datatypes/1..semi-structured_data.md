# Semi-structured Data
### The Need
Many applications require storage of complex data, where the schema may change often. In many situations, the relational model's requirement of atomic datatypes can be overkill. Storing multi-valued attributes as a set is often simpler than normalising them.
Data exchange can benefit from this kind of semi-structured data. It allows us to conveniently pass a chunk of information between the back and front ends.

### Flexibility
* Wide column representation allows each tuple to have its own set of attributes
* Sparse column representation has a fixed superset, but tuples may omit certain attributes

### Multi-Valued Datatypes
* Sets / Multisets - `{'A', 'B', 'C'}`
* Key-value Maps - `{('A','X'), ('B','Y'), ('C','Z')`
* Arrays - `[5, 8, 9, 11]`

These are modeled with a non first normal form (NFNF) data model. In some cases, a database may provide specialised support for arrays. Examples include GeoRaster, PostGIS, and SciDB.
