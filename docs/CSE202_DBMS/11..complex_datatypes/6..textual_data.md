# Textual Data
Information retrieval refers to querying on unstructured data. Stuff like keyword queries, document relevance, and mental mapping come under this.

### TF-IDF ranking
* **Term Frequency (TF)** - ranks the number of times a term $t$ appears in the document $d$. It's typically defined as $\log(TF(t, d)+1)$ as a damping factor.
* **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)** - IDF is defined as the ratio of the total number of documents in a collection that $t$ appears in. It's typically defined as $\log(N/N_d)$ as a damping factor.

### Relevance Ranking
$$r(d, Q) = \sum_{t \in Q} TF(t, d) * IDF(t)$$
Other definitions take proximity of words into account, and ignore stop words.
