# Spatial Data
Spatial databases store information related to spatial locations, and support efficient storage, indexing, and querying of said data.

### Geographic Data
* Road maps, land-usage maps, topographic maps, etc. come under this category. Geographic information systems are special-purpose databases made to store this data. 

### Geometric Data
* Stores information about how objects are constructe. A point is identified by its co-ordinates, a line by n co-ordinates, and so on. 

## Design Data
Like geometric data, design data also stores information about something geometric. It may also store other data, like how two objects interact with each other (union / intersection).

### Raster Data
Raster data contains bitamps of n dimensions. These are typically not stored in design databases.

### Vector Data
Vector data is constructed from basic geometrical objects, like points, line segments, polygons, polyhedra, etc. These are typically used to store designs.

## Spatial Queries
Spatial queries can ask questions about
* Nearest objects
* Nearest neighbours satisfying a condition
* Graph-related algorithms
* Spatial Joins
* Questions, such as if region A contains region B
