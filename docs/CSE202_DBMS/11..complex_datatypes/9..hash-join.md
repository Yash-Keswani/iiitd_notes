# Hash-join
## Hash-Join
Given two tables, if one table has a hash-index already, bring that index table to the main memory if possible. Then perform Indexed nested-loop join.

The optimiser may generate hash-tables automatically. This is significantly fast if the hash-table fits completely into the memory.

## Pseudo-Code
Pull hashed index $H(I)$ into the memory.
For each requested record ID $P$,
	put $P$ into the hash function to get $H(P)$.
	lookup $H(P)$ in $H(I)$.
	over all records $\{R_i\}$ in $H(I)$,
		if the indices also match,
			select the record.

## Large Table
If the table is large, partition it into smaller tables, by using a hashing function $h$, different from the hashing code for the indices.

Generate partitioned hash indices for tables $R$ and $S$. 

For each partition $(B_i, B_j)$ in $R, S$,
	Load $(B_i, B_j)$ into memory.
	For each searched record $P$ in $R$,
		Lookup tuples in $R$ with the same hash as $P$,
			If the predicate $\theta$ is satisfied,
				Select the tuple.
	Unload $(B_i, B_j)$ from memory.
