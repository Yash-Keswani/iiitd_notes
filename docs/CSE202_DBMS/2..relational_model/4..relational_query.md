# Relational Query
* While SQL queries are implementation-agnostic, Relational Query operations also tell the DBMS how to get the information requested
* There exist also Tuple Relational Calculus and Domain Relational Calculus, but we won't meddle with those here

### Relational Algebra
* Relational Algebra consists of sets, and operations performed on those set. It runs on six fundamental operators
	* select ($\sigma$)
	* project ($\pi$)
	* union ($\cup$)
	* set difference (-)
	* cartesian product ($X$)
	* rename ($\rho$)
