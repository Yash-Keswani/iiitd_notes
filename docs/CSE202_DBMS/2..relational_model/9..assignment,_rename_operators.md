# Assignment, Rename Operators
### Assignment
* As the name suggests, the assignment operator allows us to assign the result of one query to a variable
$$
\quad Physics \leftarrow \sigma_{\,dept_name\,=\,^"Physics^"}\, (instructors)
$$
### Rename
* The rename operator allows us to rename the result of a query under another name
$$\quad \rho_{x(A_1, A_2, ... A_n)}(E)$$
