# Select Operation
* Select operation selects all tuples that satisfy a given predicate
* It is written as $\sigma_p(r)$ , where p is the selection predicate

#### Example
Take the table `instructor`

| ID  | name  | dept_name | salary |
| --- | ----- | --------- | ------ |
| 222 | Hello | Physics   | 165005 |
| 351 | World | Chemistry | 150406 |

SELECT * FROM instructor WHERE name = "World" 
	becomes
$$\sigma_{dept\_name\,=\,^"Physics^"}\,(instructor)$$

This gives the result

| ID  | name  | dept_name | salary |
| --- | ----- | --------- | ------ |
| 222 | Hello | Physics   | 165005 |

#### Sub-operations
* relational operators are allowed. Use ligatures (like $\neq$, $\geq$, $\leq$)
* logical operators are also allowed (like $\land$ , $\lor$ , $\lnot$ )

#### Example
```
SELECT * FROM instructors WHERE dept_name = 'Physics' AND salary > 100000
```

becomes
$$\sigma_{dept\_name\,=\,'Physics'\,\land\,salary\,>\,100000 }(instructor)$$
