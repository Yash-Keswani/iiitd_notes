# Key
* A key is something which is used to identify an index in a table
* **Superkey** - $K$ is called a superkey of $R$ if it is sufficient to identify each possible relation $r(R)$
* **Candidate Key** - $K$ is called a minimal / candidate superkey of $R$ if it is a superkey of minimal cardinality 
* **Primary Key** - The primary key $P$ is an arbitrarily chosen candidate key
* **Foreign Key** - A foreign key in one table is the primary key in another table
	* A foreign key must appear in either a referencing relation, or a referenced relation
