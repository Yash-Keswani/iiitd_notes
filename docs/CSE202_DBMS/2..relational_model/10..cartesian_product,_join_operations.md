# Cartesian Product, Join Operations
### Cartesian Product
* The cartesian product operation allows us to combine informationf rom two relations
* If a column appears in two relations, we distinguish between them by writing the name of each table as a prefix in the combined table

#### Example
Table Instructors

| ID  | name  | dept_name | salary |     |
| --- | ----- | --------- | ------ | --- |
| 222 | Hello | Physics   | 165005 |     |
| 351 | World | Chemistry | 150406 |     |

Table Topics

| ID  | chapter_name        | days_alloted | dept      |
| --- | ------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| 20  | Atomic Theory       | 12           | Physics   |
| 13  | Molecular Mixing    | 15           | Chemistry |
| 25  | Waves and Particles | 10           | Physics   |

We can merge these tables with
$$\quad instructors\; X \; topics$$
To select these values, we will use $\sigma(instructors\; X \; topics)$

---
### Join
* The Join operation allows us to combine a $\sigma$ and an $X$ into a single operation
* $r \, \bowtie_{\,\theta}\; s$  is the same thing as $\sigma_\theta \;(r\; X \; s)$

#### Example
The statement
$$\quad \sigma_{\,instructors.dept\_name\,=\,topics.dept}\;(instructor\;X\; topics)$$
is equivalent to
$$\quad instructors\; \bowtie_{\;instructors.dept\_name\,=\,topics.dept}\;topics$$
