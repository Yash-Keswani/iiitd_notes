# Union, Intersection, Difference Operations
* The union operator allows us to combine two relations
* The intersection operator allows us to take the intersection of two relations
* The difference operator allows us to take the difference of two relations
* For $r \cup s$,  $r \cap s$ ,  or $r-s$  to be valid,
	* r and s must have the same number of attributes
	* the attribute domains must be compatible with each other

#### Example
$$\begin {align}

\quad &\Pi_{\,course\_ID}\,(\sigma_{semester=^"Fall^"
\,\land\,year=2017}\,(section)) \ \  \cup \\ 

\quad &\Pi_{\,course\_ID}\,(\sigma_{semester=^"Spring^"
\,\land\,year=2018}\,(section)) \\

\end {align}$$
