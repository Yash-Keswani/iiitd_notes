# Project Operation
### Project
* The project operation eliminates some attributes from the returned query
* If $A_1, A_2, ... A_n$  are attributes and $r$ is the relation, then the operation is written as $\Pi_{A_1, A_2, ... A_k}(r)$
* This will also remove any rows that are now duplicates

#### Example

| ID  | name  | dept_name | salary |
| --- | ----- | --------- | ------ |
| 222 | Hello | Physics   | 165005 |
| 351 | World | Chemistry | 150406 |

`SELECT ID, name FROM instructors`	becomes
$$\Pi_{ID,\,name}(instructor)$$
