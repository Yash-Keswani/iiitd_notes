# Trigger
A trigger is something that the system executes automatically when it sees some change in the database. The two key parts of a trigger are:

* The triggering condition. This can be update based or time based
* The action to perform when said condition is satisfied

```SQL
CREATE TRIGGER credits_earned AFTER UPDATE OF takes ON (grade)
REFERENCING new row as nrow
REFERENCING old row as orow
FOR EACH row
WHEN nrow.grade <> 'F' AND nrow.grade is not null
	AND (orow.grade = 'F' OR orow.grade is null)
BEGIN ATOMIC
	UPDATE student
	SET tot_cred = tot_cred + (
	SELECT credits
	FROM course
	WHERE course.course_id = nrow.course_id)
END
```

A trigger can be executed on a statement level instead of a row level too.

### Use Cases
* Maintaining summary data
* Replicating databases by recording delta relations (VCS basically)

### Alternatives
* Materialised views are good for maintaining summaries
* Databases provide built-in replication support

### Risks
* Loading data from a backup copy by accident
* Replicating updates where not needed
* Cascading execution
* Error from failure of critical transactions that set off the trigger

Triggers may be disabled before taking such a risk
