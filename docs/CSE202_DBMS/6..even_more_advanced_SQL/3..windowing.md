# Windowing
Windowing is a process that allows us to smooth out random variations. A good example is a moving average style of windowing.

```SQL
SELECT sale_date, SUM(value) OVER
	(ORDER BY sale_date BETWEEN rows 1 preceding and 1 following)
FROM sales
```

#### Alternative windowing style
* between rows unbounded preceding and current
* rows unbounded preceding
* range between between 10 preceding and current row
* range interval 10 day preceding

Windowing can also be done within partitions

```SQL
SELECT account_number, date_time,
	SUM(value) OVER
		(PARTITION BY account_number
		ORDER BY date_time
		rows unbounded preceding)
AS balance
FROM transaction
ORDER BY account_number, date_time	
```
