# Recursive Queries
Recursive queries are queries which call themselves within their contents.

#### Example

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE rec_prereq(course_id, prereq_id) AS (
	SELECT course_ID, prereq_ID
	FROM prereq
UNION
	SELECT rec_prereq.course_ID, prereq.prereq_ID
	FROM rec_rereq INNER JOIN prereq 
	ON rec_prereq.prereq_ID = prereq.course_ID
)

SELECT *
FROM rec_prereq
```
