# Ranking
Ranking is possible with a regular SQL query

```SQL
SELECT ID, (1+(SELECT COUNT(*)
			   FROM student_grades B
			   WHERE B.GPA > A.GPA)) as s_rank
FROM student_grades A
ORDER BY s_rank
```

but this is inefficient and ugly. SQL has a better alternative built-in

```SQL
SELECT ID, dept_name, 
	rank() OVER (partition by dept_name ORDER BY GPA desc)
	AS dept_rank
FROM dept_grades
ORDER BY dept_name, dept_rank
```

Finds the rank of students within their own department

Note that ranking is done after the group by clause. It can be used to find top n ranks, while being better than the limit keyword because it supports ranking within partitions as well.

### Other Ranking
* **percent_rank** - calculated the rank within partition
* **cume_dist** - cumulative distribution
* **row_number** - returns the row number, random in presence of duplicates

### nulls in ORDER BY
* SQL allows the user to add `nulls first` or `nulls last` at the end of an order by to choose where to place them.

### ntile
ntile allows breaking a table into n buckets
```SQL
SELECT ID, ntile(4) OVER (ORDER BY GPA desc) AS quartile
	FROM student_grades
```
