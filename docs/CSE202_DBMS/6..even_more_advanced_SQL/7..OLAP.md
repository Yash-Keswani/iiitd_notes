# OLAP
### OLTP
Online Transaction Protocol is what SQL uses to perform transactions - commits, rollbacks, etc.

### OLAP
Online Analysis Protocol, however, is used to analyse existing data. Types of OLAP are

* **Multi-Dimensional OLAP (MOLAP)** - store database cubes in multidimensional arrays
* **Relational OLAP (ROLAP)** - uses relational databases with an OLAP engine
* **Hybrid OLAP (HOLAP)** - store some summaries in memory and some in a relational database

### Multi-Dimensional Data
Data that can be expressed as axes and values along those axes is referred to as multi-dimensional data.

* **Measure attributes** - they measure some value, and can be aggregated upon
* **Dimension attributes** - they define the dimensions on which measure attributes are viewed. Think of them as axis labels

### Data Cube

A Data Cube places data of a cross-tab in three axes. Cross-Tabs can be used as views on a data cube. In SQL we use `GROUP BY CUBE` to select as a cube.

### Cross-Tabs
Cross-Tabs are multi-indexed tables, where one category has many rows inside it. It is possible to drill up or roll down on a hierarchy.

### Rollup
The rollup operation is similar to group-by, but has slight differences. If you use `ROLLUP(c1, c2, c3)`, it gives you the union of `{(c1, c2, c3), (c1, c2), (c1), ()}` This implies a sort of hierarchy between the columns. It can be used to generate multi-level aggregates.

### OLAP operations
* **Pivoting** - changing the dimension in a cross-tab
* **Slice** - create cross tab for fixed values only
* **Rollup** - moving from finer granularity to coarser granularity
* **Drill Down** - moving from coarser granularity to finer granularity
