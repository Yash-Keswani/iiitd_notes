# Concurrency
* Concurrency is achieved when transactions are not executed serially. Their instructions are interleaved with each other.
* This is good because we can stick instructions working on the same resources together, saving the amount of computation time and disk reads needed.

## Concurrency Control
* A schedule must be serialisable, recoverable, and preferably cascaedeless.
* This is achieved by a serial execution, but that is not desirable.
* Concurrency-control schemes perform a tradeoff between concurrency and incurred overhead.
