# SQL-92 Levels Consistency
## Levels of Consistency
* **Serialisable** - the default level of consistency.
* **Repeatable Read** - only committed records to be read.
	* Repeat reads return a same value, but the transaction may not be serialisable.
* **Read Committed**  - only committed records can be read.
	* Successive reads may return different, but committed values.
* **Read Uncommitted** - even uncommitted records may be read.

## Lower Consistency Uses
* A lower degree of consistency can be useful for gathering approximate information about the database.
