# Serialisability
Serialisability is the ability of a schedule to be transformed into a serial schedule without altering the result of the operation.
* **Conflict Serialisability** - avoid RAW / WAW hazards
* **View Serialisablility** - fancier stuff. It's NP-Hard

## Conflict
* Read and Read > No conflict
* Write and Read > Conflict
* Read and Write > Conflict
* Write and Write > Conflict

Any conflict presents an order, which must be preserved during any modification.

## Conflict Serialisability
A schedule $S$ is considered conflict serialisable if it is conflict-equivalent to, i.e. can be converted to a serial schedule $S'$ (achieved by swapping no conflicting instructions).

## Testing for Conflict Serialisability
We test for conflict serialisability by making a precedence graph. If and only if we see a circular dependency, the schedule is non-conflict-serialisable.
