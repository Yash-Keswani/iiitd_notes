# Weak Consistency
## Weak Levels of Consistency
Some applications can make do with lower levels of consistency. This allows for schedules that are not serialisable. These applications trade off consistency for performance.

### Examples
* Read-only transactions.
* Database statistics computed for query optimisation.
* Calculating average of a big data computation.
