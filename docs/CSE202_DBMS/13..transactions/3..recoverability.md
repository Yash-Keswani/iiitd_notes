# Recoverability
## Recoverable Schedule
A schedule is recoverable if any piece of data read from transaction $T$ by transaction $U$ is committed by $T$ before it is read by $U$.

## Dirty Read
A dirty read is a read made on data before it is committed. This is a problem. If the data is corrupted and the transaction needs to be aborted, the dirty read cascades this problem over.
* A recoverable schedule will have no dirty reads.

## Rollback Cascading
An abortion of a single transaction can lead to inconsistency in a chain of transactions. In the absence of a dirty read, cascading rollback is avoided. To fix this, we will need to rollback both the original transaction, as well as the dependent transictions.

A schedule where this does not happen is referred to as a cascadeless schedule. All cascadeless schedules are recoverable, but not the other way round.
