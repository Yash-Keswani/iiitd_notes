# RAID Level 5
## Block-Interleaved, Distributed Parity
* In this scheme, we make parity blocks. Parity block $j$ stores the $XOR$ of bits from block $j$ of each disk.

Given 5 Disks

| D1  | D2  | D3  | D4  | D5  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0  | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| 4   | P1  | 5   | 6   | 7   |
| 8   | 9   | P2  | 10  | 11  |
| 12  | 13  | 14  | P3  | 15  |
| 16  | 17  | 18  | 19  | P4  | 

Since block writes occur in parallel, the writing isn't slowed down. The $n^{th}$  parity block stores the information about the $n^{th}$ row in this table. If one disk is corrupted, we can restore its information from the parity block.
