# RAID
## Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks
* RAID is a disk organisation technique that manages many redundant disks to store the same piece of information.
* Having multiple disks in parallel gives higher read speed.
* Having redundancy gives high reliability, allowing data to be recovered even when a disk fails.

## Mirroring Technique
* In this technique, each disk is duplicated. A logical disk has two physical disks. 
* Each write is carried out on both disks, each read is carried out on either disk.
* If a disk fails, we restore from the other disk. Theoretically both disks can fail simultaneously, but the probability of that is very small.

## Mean Time to Repair
* MTR is the average amount of time required to repair a failed disk.

## Mean Time to Data Loss
* MTTDL is the amount of time required for one block of data to be unretrievable. 
* $MTTDL = MTTF \cdot MTR \cdot disk\_count$
