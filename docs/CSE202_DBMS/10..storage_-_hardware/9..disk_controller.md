# Disk Controller
* A disk controller is the interface between the computer system and the disk drive hardware. 
* When a device wants to read from or write to a sector, it gives that command to the controller.
* The controller does the job, then attaches checksums to ensure that the data isn't corrupted.
* If data is corrupted, then the checksum is nearly guaranteed to fail. This ensures that the data is stored reliably.
* It also performs remapping of bad sectors.
