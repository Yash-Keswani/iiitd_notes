# Disk Performance
## Access Time
Access time is the amount of time between the start of a request and the start of data transfer. It contains
* **Seek Time** - time taken to move the arm over the correct track. Typically 4~10 ms.
* **Rotational Latency** - time taken for the sector to be accessed by the head. Typically 4~11 ms.

## Data Transfer Rate
The rate at which data is retrieved from or stored to the disk. Typically 25~200 MBps, slower for inner tracks.

## Access Patterns
### Sequential Access Pattern
* In this process, data is accessed in successive disk blocks on the same track. This means that disk seek is only performed for the first block.

### Random Access Pattern
* In this process, successive requests can be anywhere on the disk. So, each request needs to perform its own seek.

## IOPS
* IOPS is the number of random block reads supported per second. It is 50~200 on current Magnetic Disks.

## MTTF
* Mean Time To Failure is the expected time that the disk will run theoretically without any failure. It's typically 3~5 years.
