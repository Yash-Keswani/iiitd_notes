## Decomposition
* An HDD contains lots of platters. A spindle typically has 1~5 platters on it.
* Each platter has one read-write head.
* Each platter has 50~100k tracks in it
* Each track has sectors in it. Inner tracks have 500~1000 sectors while outer tracks have 1000~2000 sectors
* A block is the smallest unit of storage allocation. It is typically 4~16 kB in size.
* A cylinder $i$ contain's the $i^{th}$ track of each platter 

## Read-Write
* The read/write head needs to be above the correct sector to read from it. 
* The disk arm swings to the correct position to accomplish this.
* Meanwhile the disk spins continuously. Eventually, the track head will be in the correct position.
