# RAID Level 6
## P + Q Redundancy Scheme
Similar to level 5, but instead stores two correction blocks $(P, Q)$. This protects from multiple simultaneous disk failures.

| D1  | D2  | D3  | D4  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0  | 0   | 1   | P1  |
| P2  | P3  | 2   | 3   |
| 4   | P4  | P5  | 5   |
| 6   | 7   | P6  | P7  |

This increases the single parity block to guard against multiple disk failures. It gives better reliability than RAID 5
