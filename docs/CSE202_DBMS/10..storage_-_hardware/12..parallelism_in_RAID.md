# Parallelism In RAID
## Bit-Level Striping
* Splits the bits of each byte into multiple disks. 
* For $8$ disks, each bit $8n+i$ is written to the $i^{th}$ disk.

## Block-Level Striping
* For $n$ disks, block $i$ goes to the disk $[(i\, \% \,n)+ 1]$.
* In this way, requests for different blocks can run in parallel, which will speed up a request for a large file.
