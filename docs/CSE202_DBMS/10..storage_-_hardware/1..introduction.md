# Introduction
## Volatility
* **Volatile** - Volatile data is lost when the power of the device is switched off
* **Non-Volatile** - non-volatile information persists even after the device is switched off

## Storage Factors
* Speed of data access
* Cost of data storage
* Reliability of data retrieval

## Storage Hierarchy
* **Primary** - storage is the fastest. It is also volatile. Primary data sources include the cache and the main memory.
* **Secondary** - storage includes non-volatile on-line storage. It includes flash memory and magnetic (HDD) discs.
* **Tertiary** - storage is off-line and used for archival. It is non-volatile. It has a slow access time. It includes magnetic tapes and optical storage.

## Interaction Interfaces
* **SATA** - Serial ATA - supports data transfer of up to 6 Gb/s
* **SAS** - Serial Attached SCSI - supports upto 12 Gb/s
* **NVMe** - Non-Volatile Memory Express - supports up to 24 Gb/s

## Storage Interfaces
* **SAN** - Storage Area Network - a large number of disks connected to servers by a high-speed network.
* **NAS** - Network Attached Storage - a networked storage that provides a file using networked file system protocol rather than a disc interface.
