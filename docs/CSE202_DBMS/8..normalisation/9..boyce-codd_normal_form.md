# Boyce-codd Normal Form
### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
In Boyce-Codd Normal Form, for any dependency $X \to A$, one of the following must be obeyed
* $A \subset X$
* $X$ is a superkey for $R$

* While 3NF mandates that all non-prime attributes depend on nothing but a key, BCNF mandates this on prime attributes as well, unless they by themselves count as a superkey

This format is somewhat esoteric, you won't see it very frequently.
