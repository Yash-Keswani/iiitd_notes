# Design Guidelines
### Informal Guidelines for Good Design
* Make sure that the semantics of the attributes are clear in the schema
	* Everything in an entity set except the foreign key should only describe something about the entity itself
	
* Reduce redundant information
	* DRY - don't repeat yourself. This wastes space
	
* Avoid NULL value as much as possible
	* null is a super-common reason that code gets messed up. avoid it wherever possible
	
* Disallow the possibility of generating spurious tuples
	* This is seen in lossy reconstruction, which generates spurious (extra) tuples

* Extra guideline - Preserve dependencies as much as possible
