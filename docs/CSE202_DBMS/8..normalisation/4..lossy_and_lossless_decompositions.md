# Lossy And Lossless Decompositions
Consider decomposing the relational schema $R$ into $R_1$ and $R_2$. 

We say that this decomposition is lossless if no information is lost when we recompose the two schemas. Formally, this is written as
$$\Pi_{R1}(r) \bowtie \Pi_{R2}(r)=r$$
On the other hand, 
$$\Pi_{R1}(r) \bowtie \Pi_{R2}(r) \subset r$$
is referred to as a lossless decomposition.

(<u>ID</u>, name, street, city, salary) > (<u>ID</u>, name, street, city) , (<u>name</u>, salary) is a lossy decomposition

(<u>ID</u>, name, street, city, salary) > (<u>ID</u>, name, street, city) , (<u>ID</u>, salary) is a lossless decomposition

In general, we can get a lossless decomposition by carrying over the primary key into tables that we decompose the main table into.
