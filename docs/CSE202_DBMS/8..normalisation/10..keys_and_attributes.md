# Keys And Attributes
### Superkey and Key
* Say there is a superkey $K$ that identifies an attribute each tuple in a relation $R$ distinctly. For any item $i$ with attributes $\{A_j\}$ in the table, we can say that $\forall A_j, K(i) \to A_j$ 
* A key is a superkey such that there $\nexists k \subset K$ such that $k$ is a valid superkey of $R$ as well
* A key may either be a primary key or a candidate key

### Prime Attribute
* A prime attribute is a member of some candidate key
* A non-prime member is conversely not a part of any candidate key
