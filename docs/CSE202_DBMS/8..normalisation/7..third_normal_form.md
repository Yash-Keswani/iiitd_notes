# Third Normal Form (3NF)
* 3NF mandates that no non-prime attribute $A$ in $R$ is transitively dependent on the primary key
* In somewhat poetic terms, each attribute must tell something about a key, a whole (candidate) key, and nothing but that key
* 1NF guarantees that there is a key. 2NF guarantees that every attribute tells something about a whole key. 3NF guarantees that every attribute tells something about a key, and about nothing else in the table.
* If $X \to A$ holds in $R$, then either
	* $X$ is a superkey of $R$, or
	* $A$ is a prime attribute of $R$ 

Note that normalisation is only necessary if $A$ is a non-prime attribute of r. Consider the scenario with the relation `Employee(SSN, emp_ID, salary)`. In this, while SSN -> emp_ID and emp_ID -> salary, this is not a concern because both are valid candidate keys

The previous example can be converted to 3NF as follows

The functional dependencies are
		
The schemas are
        Lot - (<u>property_ID</u>, state, lot, lot_area, base_price)
        Tax - (<u>state</u>, tax_rate)

lot_area is not a candidate key. `base_price` is not directly dependent on property_ID. So, it does not obey 3NF, and we will add it to a new table
        property_ID -> lot, lot_area, state
        lot, lot_area -> base_price
        state -> tax_rate
		
The new schema is
	Prices - (<u>lot_area</u>, price)
