# Normalisation
Normalisation is the process of analysing functional dependencies and primary keys so as to achieve relational schemas that adhere as closely to design guidelines as possible
* It involves decomposing improper relations into relations with good forms
* These decompositions must be lossless and preserve dependencies

### The Need for Normalisation
* Normalisation ensures that the database is of the highest quality, and with minimal insertion, deletion, and update anomalies
