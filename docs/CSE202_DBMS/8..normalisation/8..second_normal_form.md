# Second Normal Form (2NF)
2NF predicates that in a relation $R$, there is no (non-prime) attribute $A$ such that,
* $c \to A$ , such that $c \subset C$ , where C is a candidate key
* It means that each attribute is dependent on the whole candidate key

Consider the following schema
        Lot - (<u>property_ID</u>, <state, lot>, lot_area, base_price, tax_rate)

Here are the functional dependencies
        property_ID -> lot, lot_area, state
        lot, lot_area -> base_price
        state -> tax_rate

State, lot is a candidate key. But tax_rate is only dependent on a part of this candidate key, so we will move it to a new table.
        Lot - (<u>property_ID</u>, <state, lot>, lot_area, base_price)
        Tax - (<u>state</u>, tax_rate)

This schema in 2NF now.
