# Evaluation Plans
## Evaluation Plan
An evaluation plan gives atomic implementation-specific steps to the processing engine to do its job.

For example, the query `SELECT * FROM instructors WITH salary < 75000` will process to something like
* Perform complete relation scan and discard instructors with salary > 7500

An RAE can be evaluated in several different ways, and its performance can be evaluated on various metrics as well.
