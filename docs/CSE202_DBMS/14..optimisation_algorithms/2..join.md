# Join
## Nested Loop 
* Chosen very typically when multiple values have to be compared.

### Pseudo-Code
For each pair $P = (R_i, R_j)$ in the cartesian product,
	if $P$ satisfies predicate $\theta$,
		select P.
	else,
		do nothing.


## Block Nested Loop
* Similar to nested loop, but compares block by block as well

## Pseudo-Code
For each block pair $B = (B_r, B_s)$,
	For each record pair $P = (R_i, R_j)$,
		If $P$ satisfies predicate $\theta$,
			select P.
		else,
			do nothing.
