# Indexed Nested Loop Join
This is used over file scan when,
* the join is an equi-join / natural join, and,
* the inner relation has an index. note that an index may be created just for a join.

## Pseudo-Code
store the index column of one table in memory.
for each needed tuple,
	use the index to look up needed tuple by index,
		if found, select it.
