# File Scan
File Scan is a form of linear search. It scans each file block and tests each record $R_i$ to see if it satisfies the given predicate $\theta$.

* If there are $n$ blocks in the file, transferred in this query, then the cost is $n + 1 (seek)$. 
* If selection is done on a key attribute, then we can stop on finding the record. This gives an average cost of $n/2 + 1$
* Binary search can also be performed on a sorted attribute, but a sorted attribute is just an index, which we can search far more quickly on.
