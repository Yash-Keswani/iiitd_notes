# Multi-query Optimisation
## Multi-Query Optimisation
Alternatives for evaluating operation trees are

### Materialisation
Store the result of one query element directly on the disk. The optimiser generates a plan such that common elements of queries $\{Q_i\}$ are executed only once, stored on the disk, then reused. 
* This is also referred to as flyweighting or caching.

## Pipelining
As the result of one tuple comes, pass it to the next operation. Consider WHERE-JOIN-GROUPBY-HAVING as a pipeline similar to the RISC pipeline. This can be parallelised for speed-up.
* not possible in something like a sort or a hash join.
* cheaper than materialisation, as there is no need to store to disk.

#### Demand Driven
 * a.k.a. lazy evaluation, pull model.
 * The operation latter in the pipeline pulls records from the operation behind in the pipeline.

#### Producer Driven
* a.k.a. eager ealuation, push model.
* The operation behind in the pipeline immediately pushes ahead in the pipeline
