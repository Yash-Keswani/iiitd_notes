# Index Scans
## Equality on Key
* to retrieve a single record that satisfy equality predicate $\theta$
* $\omega = h_i * (t_t + t_s) + t_s + t_t$ 
* all blocks of the index table are loaded into the memory, then a seek is done to fetch the one matching the index.

## Equality on Non-Key
* to retrieve $n$ records that match general predicate $\theta$ 
* $\omega = h_i * (t_T + t_S) + t_S + t_T * n$ 
* assuming seek has to be done only once because blocks are adjacent

## Secondary Index - Single Key
* $\omega = (h_i+1)*(t_T+t_S)$ 
* cost to load the index table into the memory, then to seek and fetch the desired element.

## Secondary Index - Non-Key
* $\omega = (h_i + n)*(t_T + t_S)$
* this scenario is assuming that each of the non-key records is in a different block. in this scenario, it can be quite expensive.
