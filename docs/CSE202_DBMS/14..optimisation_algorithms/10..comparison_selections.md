# Comparison Selections
## Sorted Selection
* perform a linear file scan in the part ahead or behind the specified index, depending on the request.

## Unsorted Selection
* For $A \ge V$ , use index to find the first tuple, then scan relations sequentially from there.
* For $A \le V$, scan leaf pages for index to find pointers till first entry $> V$.
* Retrieve record in either case
* This requires an IO per record, which can be larger than a linear file scan.
