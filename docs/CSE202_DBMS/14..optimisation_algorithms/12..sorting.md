# Sorting
* sorting can be done logically through an index, as opposed to physical. This may lead to a lot of disk block accesses though. So, it's desirable to sort the records physically.
* for relations that fit in memory, quicksort is good.
* for relations that don't fit in memory, external sort-merge works better because it's in-place.

### Differences from Mergesort
* processing is done block-by-block
* the merging is an $N$-way merge between $M$ blocks.
