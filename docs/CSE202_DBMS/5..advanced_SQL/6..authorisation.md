### GRANT / REVOKE
* the GRANT keyword is used to give some privileges to some user
	* `GRANT <privilege list> ON <relation / view> TO <user list>`
* the REVOKE keyword has the opposite function
* any privilege between select, insert, update, delete, and `all` can be granted to a user, on a certain table or view
* the granter must already have the privilege that they are granting
* the default role is `public`. it includes all users without a role
* revoke may contain cascade or restrict at the end, which decides how to handle permission dependency conflicts

 ### Roles
 * an SQL role is like a discord server role
 * `CREATE role <name>` creates a role
 * `GRANT <role> to <users>` grants this role to some users
