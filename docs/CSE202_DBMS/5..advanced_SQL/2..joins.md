# Joins
### Join
* a join operation takes two relations and returns the result of their merging
* a join operation is a cartesian product that is followed by the application of some condition
* the result is frequently used in the FROM clause

### Natural Join
* the natural join returns tuples which have the same values for all common attributes, and retains a single copy of each common column
* the natural join is the simplest way to normalise

#### Example
table customer

| customer_ID | customer_name |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 100         | Hello         |
| 200         | World         |

table seller

| seller_ID | customer_ID | seller_name |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 500       | 100         | Panda       |
| 560       | 200         | Cat         |

```SQL
SELECT * 
FROM customer NATURAL JOIN seller
```

returns

| customer_ID | seller_ID | customer_name | seller_name |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| 100         | 500       | Hello         | Panda       |
| 200         | 560       | World         | Cat         |

### Outer Join
* outer join is a type of join that involves zero information loss
* all rows are preserved between relations, adding null values if needed
* we can use left outer join, right outer join, or full outer join

### Inner Join
* inner join is the default type of join, unless mentioned otherwise
* inner join preserves consistency (no nulls present), but may cause loss of data

#### Example

| customer_ID | customer_name |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 100         | Hello         |
| 200         | World         |
| 300         | Is            |
| 400         | A             |
| 500         | Square        |

| seller_ID | seller_name | customer_ID |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 150       | Green       | 100         |
| 250       | Is          | 200         |
| 350       | My          | 600         |
| 450       | Pepper      | 800         |

```SQL
seller INNER JOIN customer ON seller.customer_ID = customer.customer_ID
```

| seller_ID | seller_name | customer_ID | customer_name |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 150       | Green       | 100         | Hello         |
| 250       | Is          | 200         | World         |

```sql
seller LEFT JOIN customer ON seller.customer_ID = customer.customer_ID
```
(left join is shorthand for left outer join)

| seller_ID | seller_name | customer_ID | customer_name |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 150       | Green       | 100         | Hello         |
| 250       | Is          | 200         | World         |
| 350       | My          | null        | null          |
| 450       | Pepper      | null        | null          |

```SQL
seller FULL OUTER JOIN customer ON seller.customer_ID = customer.customer_ID
```

| seller_ID | seller_name | customer_ID | customer_name |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 150       | Green       | 100         | Hello         |
| 250       | Is          | 200         | World         |
| 350       | My          | null        | null          |
| 450       | Pepper      | null        | null          |
| null      | null        | 300         | Is            |
| null      | null        | 400         | A             |
| null      | null        | 500         | Square        |
