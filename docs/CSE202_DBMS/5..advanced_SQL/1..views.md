# Views
### Creation
 ```sql
 CREATE view <view name> (columns) as <query>
 ```
 creates a view

### Updation
```sql
INSERT INTO <view name>
	VALUES (tuple)
```
may add the tuple to the view. The view can
* insert the tuple
* reject the tuple

this is really bad because the tuple's insert condition can be super ultra ambiguous
