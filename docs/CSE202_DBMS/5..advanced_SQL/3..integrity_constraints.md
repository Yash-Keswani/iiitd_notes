# Integrity Constraints
An integrity constraint guards your databse from accidental damage by checking all inserted data for consistency

### Constraints on a single relation
#### not null
* an attribute cannot be null. 
* `name varchar(20) NOT NULL`

#### unique
* no two values under this attribute can be equal
* this makes the attribute a candidate key
* this candidate key is allowed to be null, as opposed to a primary key

#### check
* ensures that any insertion obeys a certain predicate
* `check (season in ('Fall', 'Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer'))`

### Referential Integrity
* ensures that each foreign key has two ends. 
* we do this by defining attribute A in table R as a foreign key pointing to primary key P in table S
* `FOREIGN KEY (dept_name) REFERENCES department (dept_name)` is how we declare a foreign key

#### Integrity violation response
* In response to any violation of referential integrity, the DBMS can respond in the following ways
	* reject the action that causes the violation
	* cascade that action to the referencers
	* set the value to null
	* set the value to a preset default

#### Inserting without causing violations
You can do this by:
* insert parent before child
* set parents to null initially, update on inserting child
* defer constraint checking
