# Aggregation Functions
Aggregation functions perform some operations on a set of rows. These include

* **Avg** 
* **Min**
* **Max**
* **Sum**
* **Count**

#### Example
```SQL
SELECT count(*) FROM my_table
```

### GROUP BY
GROUP BY keyword groups entries by some equality on some attribute
* note that whichever attribute you choose to group by must be present in the SELECT clause

### HAVING
HAVING keyword is the same as where, except it acts after group by

#### Example

```SQL
SELECT dept_name, avg(salary) as avg_salary
FROM instructor
GROUP BY dept_name
HAVING avg(salary) > 42000;
```
