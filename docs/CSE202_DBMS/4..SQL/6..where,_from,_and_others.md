# Where, From, And Others
### WHERE
* the where clause tells us the predicate to pick entries
* relational and logical operators may be used in the predicate
* we can also compare tuples against tuples, i.e. WHERE (A, B) < (C, D)

### FROM
* the from clause gives us the domain of the query
* `instructor X teaches` becomes `FROM instructor, teaches`
* common attributes get a prefix of <table.> at the start of their name

### AS
* the `AS` operator can be used to rename pretty much anything
* it can also be omitted giving the same result. `instructor AS T` and `instructor T` do the same thing

### ORDER BY
* ORDER BY tells SQL the order to return result rows of the query in
* can be done on multiple attributes for primary and secondary sorting keys
* `desc` or `asc` can be put at the end of each sorting key to specify the order of sorting

### Between / and
* the between operator is a really dumb way to use $\geq$ and $\leq$ together. 
* `WHERE salary between 90000 and 100000`
