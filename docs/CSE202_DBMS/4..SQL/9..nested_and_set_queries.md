# Nested And Set Queries
### Nested Queries
in 

```SQL
SELECT A1, A2, ... An
FROM r1, r2, ... rn
WHERE P
```

* one can replace $r_i$  with any valid subquery
* an operation can be used on a subquery for the predicate in WHERE
* $A_i$ can be replaced with any subquery that generates a single value

### IN
* If a query returns a set (i.e., single column), we can check if a member is present in it using the `IN` keyword

#### Example
```SQL
SELECT course_ID
FROM course_offerings
WHERE course_year=2018 and course_ID in
	(SELECT course_ID
	 FROM course_offerings
	 WHERE course_year=2017)
```

### Some, All clauses
* The some clause selects all elements that fulfil a condition with some elements in a set
* The all clause selects all elements that fulfil a condition with all elements of a set

#### Example
```SQL
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE dept_name = 'Physics' AND
	salary > ALL (
		SELECT salary
		FROM instructor
		WHERE dept_name = 'Biology'
	)
```

This query selects physics professors who earn more than every biology professor

### Exists, Not exists,  Except clauses
```SQL
SELECT course_ID
FROM section as S
WHERE 
	semester = 'Fall' 
	and course_year = 2017 
	and EXISTS (
		SELECT *
		FROM section as T
		WHERE
			semester = 'Spring'
			and course_year = 2018
			and S.course_ID = T.course_ID
	)
```

EXCEPT is just a set difference. A EXCEPT B returns A - B
