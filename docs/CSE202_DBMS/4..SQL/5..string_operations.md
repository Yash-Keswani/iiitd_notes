# String Operations
### LIKE
* the like keyword is used to match a pattern in SQL
* `%` matches any substring, while `_` matches any character

### ESCAPE
* the escape keyword is used to clarify the escape character in the string
* `LIKE '100 \%' ESCAPE '\'` tells us to escape the % sign

 ### Miscellaneous
 * concatenation can be done with `||`
 * case can be changed with `LOWER()` and `UPPER()`
 * we can find string length or take substrings too
