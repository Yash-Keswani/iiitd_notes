# Select
### SELECT
* SELECT lists all the mentioned attributes from the result of a query
* corresponds to project ($\Pi$) from relational algebra
* note that names are case-insensitive
* by default, select chooses duplicate entries as well
* use DISTINCT to specify that duplicates should not be selected, and ALL to specify that they ahould be
* an asterisk denotes all attributes

#### Slightly more funky stuff
* the select parameter can be a literal. If it is so, then it will return a table with one column and one row for each entry in the table, and each entry is filled with the given literal
* you can perform arithmetic operations on attributes while selecting them
* use the `AS` keyword to rename anything you want to select
