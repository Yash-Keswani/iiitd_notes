# Set Operations
### And, Not, Or
* these are put inside the `WHERE` or `HAVING` clauses

### UNION, INTERSECTION
* these are put between two `SELECT` clauses
* append `all` to the keyword to retain duplicates

### Impact of null values
* the result of any comparison with a null value is returned as `unknown`
* false and unknown is false, true and unknown is true (absorption law)
* every other comparison returns unknown
* if unknown is returned to the `WHERE` clause, then it is treated as false.
