#### Initial / Analysis Phase
* The initial phase involves almost no code. It is completely planning-oriented
* It is similar to the analysis phase of programming. It involves looking at the problems of the users and thinking of potential ways to solve them

#### Design Phase
* The defining step of this phase is choosing a data model
* One this is done, the requirements of the problem description are applied onto the data model
* Then, this data model is converted into a conceptual schema. Metadata related to the operations needed to be performed on said data is taken

#### Implementation Phase
* The abstract data model is turned into a concrete database
* **Logical Design** - involves deciding relation schemas. Additionally, attributes are shortlisted and pruned from a business perspective, and the organisation is optimised for memory and speed efficiency
