# Cardinality
Cardinality decides how many members are present in a relationship on either side. The mapping of cardinality between relationships can be:

* One to One
* One to Many
* Many to One
* Many to Many

### Example
In the examples discussed so far:

* soldier --> tent is a one-one relationship. one soldier can only reside in one tent, and one tent can house only soldier
* army --> soldier is a one-many relationship. there are many soldiers fighting in the army, but a soldier can be present in only one army
* soldier --> weapon is a many-many relationship. a soldier can hold many kinds of weapons, and a weapon variety can be used by any amount of soldiers
* soldier --> leader is a many-one relationship. each soldier is placed under only one leader, and one leader can lead a group of many soldiers

### Representation of Cardinality
* a directed line signifies one
* an undirected line signifies many

```plantuml
allowmixing
class soldier{
	<u>soldier_ID</u>
	name
	equipped_weapon
}
class weapon{
	<u>weapon_ID</u>
	weapon_name
	firepower
}
class tent{
	<u>tent_ID</u>
	tent_name
	tent_colour
}
class leader{
	<u>regiment_ID</u>
	name
	charisma
}
class army{
	<u>army_ID</u>
}
rectangle uses
rectangle resides_in
rectangle works_for
rectangle serves_in

soldier - uses 
uses -  weapon

leader <- works_for
works_for - soldier

soldier <-- resides_in
resides_in --> tent

army <-- serves_in
serves_in -- soldier

```

### Specific Cardinality Constraints
Like UML diagrams, ER diagrams can also show numbered cardinality constraints. These are also indicated in the same manner

#### Example
A soldier must be present in one army, and one army only. Meanwhile an army must contain at least one soldier

```plantuml
allowmixing
left to right direction 

class soldier{
	<u>soldier_ID</u>
	name
	equipped_weapon
}
class army{
	<u>army_ID</u>
}
rectangle serves_in

army "  1..*"<--- serves_in
serves_in ---"1..1" soldier

```
