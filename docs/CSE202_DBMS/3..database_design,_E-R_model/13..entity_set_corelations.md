# Entity Set Corelations
### Specialisation
* A specialisation indicates that the child has all attributes of the parent, but also adds something more
* This is referred to as attribute inheritance, and drawn with a triangular arrow

```plantuml
allowmixing
class feline{
	fur_colour
}
class cat{
	meowing_pitch
}
class leopard{
	teeth_sharpness
}

feline <|-- leopard
feline <|-- cat
```
#### Overlapping and Disjoint Specialisation
* Overlapping children sets means that that a member of a parent class can belong in both child classes
* Meanwhile in disjoint specialisation, a parent can only have one of its children's attributes

```plantuml
allowmixing
class cat{
	meowing pitch
}
together {
class spotted_cat{
	spot_size
}
class plain_cat{
	plainness_index
}
class wet_cat{
	dampness
}
}

cat <|-- spotted_cat
cat <|-- plain_cat
(plain_cat, cat) - wet_cat
wet_cat -right (spotted_cat, cat)

```

### Generalisation
A generalisation is the inverse of a specialisation. In it, a number of entity sets sharing some features are combined into a higher-level set. The terms specialisation and generalisation are interchangeable

### Completeness Contstraint
The completeness constraint specifies whether or not a parent entity must overlap with one of its children
* **Total Generalisation** - The parent must share all attributes with one of its children
* **Partial Generalisation** - The parent need not have the exact same attributes as any of its children

A total generalisation is indicated with a broken line, and a total label on the diagram.

### Aggreagation
In an aggregation, multiple entities and / or relationships are abstracted into one aggregate entity

```plantuml
allowmixing
package "" as th{
	class writer{
	}
	class guide{
	}
	class reviewer{
	}

	rectangle participate_in

	writer - participate_in
	guide -- participate_in
	participate_in - reviewer
}

rectangle is_given
th -- is_given
is_given - remarks
```
