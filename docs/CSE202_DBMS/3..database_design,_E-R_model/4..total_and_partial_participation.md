# Total And Partial Participation
### Total Participation
Total Participation indicates that every entity in this set participates in the relationship set. It is indicated with a double line

### Partial Participation
Partial Participation is observed when some entities don't necessarily participate in any relationship in the relationship set. These can be represented with just a single line

### Example
Each soldier serves in an army, and each army must have soldiers in it. Additionally, the soldier-army relation is many-to-one

```plantuml
allowmixing
skinparam linetype ortho
class soldier{
	<u>soldier_ID</u>
	name
	equipped_weapon
}
class army{
	<u>army_ID</u>
}
rectangle serves_in


army <-[hidden]- serves_in
army <-- serves_in
army <-- serves_in
army <-[hidden]- serves_in

serves_in -[hidden]- soldier
serves_in -[hidden]- soldier
serves_in -- soldier
serves_in -- soldier
serves_in -[hidden]- soldier
serves_in -[hidden]- soldier

```
