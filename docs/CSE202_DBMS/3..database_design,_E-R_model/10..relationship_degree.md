The degree expresses the number of participants involved in a relationship. This is typically two

#### Example
```
A soldier's expertise in a weapon is measured using a number of parameters. These include accuracy, precision, consistency, and ease of manouevering. The general wants us to store the expertise reports of each soldier, so he can think of the thresholds for expertise tiers [he is insistent on relative grading].
```

Here we see the ternary relationship manifest as:

* Soldier <- has an expertise in -> Weapon
                                 -> Expertise report
