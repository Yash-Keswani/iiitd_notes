# Weak Entity Set
A weak entity set is one that has to rely on another entity set for its existence

* This entity is known as its identifying entity
* Instead of associating a primary key with a weak entity, we use the identifying entity, (along with extra attributes called the discriminator) to uniquely identify a weak entity
* The identifying entity set is said to own the weak entity set
* This relationship is referred to as an identifying relationship

#### Representation of Weak Entity Set
* A weak entity is represented in an E-R diagram with a double rectangle
* The discriminator is underlined with a dashed line
* The relationship set connecting the weak entity to the identifying relationship is depicted as a double diamond
 
#### Example
```plantuml
allowmixing
class weapon{
	<u>weapon_id</u>
	<u>firepower</u>
}
class soldier{
	<u>soldier_id</u>
	name
	equipped_weapon
}
rectangle uses

soldier - uses
uses - weapon
```
