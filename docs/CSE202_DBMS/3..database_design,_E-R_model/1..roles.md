# Roles
#### Role
A role is what we call a position that an entity from an entity set fills in

* Two different roles need not be occupied by different entities. They may very well be filled in by the same entity

### Example
```
Handing any weapon to any soldier is not a very smart idea. So, our civilisation needs to come up with an intelligent and hierarchical way to grant soldiers access to weaponry.

To have access to a gun, one must first be adept with the bow-and-arrow. To have access to a poleaxe, one must first be adept with the lance. The general wants us to generalise this concept to all weapons.
```

This leads us to a special kind of relation

* Weapon <- prerequisite of -> Weapon
