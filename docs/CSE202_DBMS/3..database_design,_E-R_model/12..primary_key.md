# Primary Key
A primary key is the attribute / set of attributes by which we can distinctly identify a:
1) Entity
2) Relationship
3) Weak Entity

#### Entity
* Each entity in an entity set is distinct
* To materialise this distinctness, the primary key is used. No two entities are allowed to have the same primary key

#### Relationship
* Let $R$ be a relationship involving $n$ entities, $\{E_i\}^n$
* The primary key for $R$ is the union of the primary keys of each set in $\{E_i\}^n$
* If the relationship set has attributes $\{A_i\}^m$  associated with it, then its primary key will also have $\{A_i\}^m$ associated with it

##### Choosing based on cardinality of relationship
* **Many-to-Many**: The preceding union of primary keys is a minimal superkey, and is chosen as the primary key
* **One-to-Many**: The primary key of the "Many" side is a minimal superkey and is used as the primary key
* **One-to-One**: The primary key of either one of the participating entity sets can count as the primary key

#### Weak Entity
* A weak entity can be discriminated using the foreign key pointing to the identifying entity, on which it relies for existence
