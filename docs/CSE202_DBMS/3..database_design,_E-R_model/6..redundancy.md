# Redundancy
### Redundant Attributes

A redundant attribute is one that is present in multiple related entity sets. The solutiont to this redundancy is to remove it from all entity sets except one.

### Example
```plantuml
allowmixing
class soldier{
	<u>soldier_id</u>
	equipped_weapon
	weapon_firepower
}
class weapon{
	<u>weapon_id</u>
	firepower
}
rectangle uses

soldier - uses
uses - weapon
```
