# B+ Tree
## Why B+ Trees?
* ISAM requires overflow block usage, which makes execution slower
* Periodic reoragnisation of the full file is requied
* B+ trees reorganise themselves with small local changes, and do not need such reorganisation.
* Note that they come with a minor space overhead, but it is worth the efficiency.

## Constraints
* All paths from root ot a leaf are of the same length
* A tree of size n can have up to $n-1$ values and $n$ children
* Each node has at least half-filled children (rounded up)
* Each node is at least half-full (rounded up)
* A B+ Tree counts as a multi-level sparse index.
* The tree height is no more than $\lceil log_{\lceil n/2 \rceil} (K) \rceil$  height, for $K$ search key values.
* A node is generally the same size as a disk block, 4KB.
