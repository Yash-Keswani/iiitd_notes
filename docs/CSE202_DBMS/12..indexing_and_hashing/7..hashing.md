# Hashing
## Static Hashing
* A bucket is a unit of storage with one or more entries. (typically a disk block). 
	* A bucket's adress is the output of a hash function, with the input being the index.
	* The bucket contains pointer/s to any row/s.
* In a hash index, bucket store pointers to records
* In a hash file-organisation, buckets store the records themselves
* This doesn't work well when a database significantly grows or shrinks. We can restructure the index, but that leads to a non-uniform time expenditure.

## Overflow Buckets
* Overflow buckets exist for when a bucket gets filled up.
* This can happen due to a lack of buckets, or a skew in distribution of records.
* Overflow buckets are typically kept as a linked list.

## Dynamic Hashing
* In Periodic Rehashing, hashing is done periodically. Say if the number of entries is 1.5x the size of the hash table. We make a new table of larger size, and reload all entries into them
* Linear Hashing does rehashing in an incremental manner.
* Extendable Hashing allows sharing of a bucket by multiple hash values, allowing to increase the number of hash entries without increasing number of buckets.

## Hashing vs. Ordered Indexing
* Hashes involve periodic reorganisation, which is suboptimal in databases with lots of insertions and deletions.
* Hashes are better at retrieving records of a specific key, ordered indices are better at pulling out ranges. Hashing is not used a lot in practice
