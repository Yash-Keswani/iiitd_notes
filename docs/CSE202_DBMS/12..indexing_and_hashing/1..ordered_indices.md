# Ordered Indices
## Ordered Index
In an ordered index, keys are stored in the order that we want to parse them over.

## Clustering Index
The index whose search key specifies the sequential order of the file is referred to as a clustering or a primary index. It is typically (but not necessarily) the primary key.

## Secondary Index
An index whose search key is in an order different from the sequential order of the file is referred to as a non-clustering or secondary index.

## Index-Sequential Access File (ISAM)
an ISAM is a sequential file ordered on a search key, with a clustering index on it. These are designed for applications that require both sequential and random access to records.
