# Tree Building
No matter what you do, inserting in a sorted fashion makes life easy.

## Bulk Loading
* After sorting in ascending order, dump all nodes in the tree from smallest to largest

## Bottom-Up Construction
* After sorting in ascending order, set the value of all the leaf nodes
* Build up the layers above one by one from these
* This is what most DBMS use
