# Bitmap Indices
## Bitmap Index
A bitmap index is a special kind of index designed for querying on multiple keys efficiently.

* Records are assumed to be in numerically sequential form.
	* Given a number $n$ it must be easy to retrieve the $n$'th record, especially if records are of fixed size
* It's great for records that take on a relatively small number of distinct values

## Storage Mechanism
A bitmap index is basically an inverted hash table on the row

| income_level |
| ------------ |
| L1           |
| L2           |
| L1           |
| L4           |
| L3           | 

becomes

```
L1 - 10100
L2 - 01000
L3 - 00001
L4 - 00010
L5 - 00000
```

These can be great for applying boolean algebra on (e.g., select all people who have income level L1 or L2, etc.)
