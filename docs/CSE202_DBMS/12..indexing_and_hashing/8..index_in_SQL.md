# Index In SQL
## Index Creation
```SQL
CREATE INDEX <index-name> ON <relation-name> (<attributes>)
```

* Use `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` to indirectly force uniqueness on the index, although it isn't needed if the SQL dialect has the `unique` integrity constraint

## Index Deletion
```SQL
DROP INDEX <index-name>
```

Most DBMS allow specification for type of index and clustering.
