# Operations On B+ Trees
## Insertion
* Search the leaf nodes for the correct place to put the new value (logarthmically complex process). 
* If there's a vacant slot in the node, place it there.
* If there's no vacant slot in the node, break it into two nodes.
* Insert the left-most value of the new node in the parent.
* Repeat this process till you get to the root.
* If the tree is full, make a new layer (at the top).

## Deletion
* Remove the value from the leaf layer
* If the size of the node falls below half, merge it with the previous node
* Propagate changes upwards accordingly
