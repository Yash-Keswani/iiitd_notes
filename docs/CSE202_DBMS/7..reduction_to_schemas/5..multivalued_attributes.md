# Multivalued Attributes
* Multivalued attributes are not included in the same table
* They are included in another table, which contains necessary information

### Example
```plantuml
allowmixing
class soldier{
	<u>soldier_ID</u>
	{field} {ranks}
}
```
soldier(<u>soldier_ID</u>)
ranks(<u>soldier_ID</u>, rank)

so, if soldier A has rank A in weapon X, and rank B in weapon Y. Then the the ranks table is filled as

(A, A, X)
(A, B, Y)
