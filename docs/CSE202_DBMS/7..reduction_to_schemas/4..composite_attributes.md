# Composite Attributes
* Composite attributes are flattened into their sub-attributes
* One possible way is to use a form of Hamiltonian Notation, adding the name of the parent attribute as a prefix for each child attributes
* The prefix may be omitted if it is redundant, but if you choose proper names for child attributes then it shouldn't be

### Example
```plantuml
allowmixing
class soldier{
	<u>soldier_ID</u>
	name
	equipped_weapon
	battle_history
	\tbattle_count
	\tvictories
	\tenemies_defeated
}

```
soldier(<u>soldier_ID</u>, name, equipped_weapon,  b_his_count, b_his_victories, b_his_enemies_defeated)
