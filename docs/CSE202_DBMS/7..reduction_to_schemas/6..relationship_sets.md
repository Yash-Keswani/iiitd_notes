# Relationship Sets
### One-One 
A foreign key to either table is stored in the other table

```plantuml
allowmixing
class river{
	<u>river_ID</u>
	name
}
class dam{
	<u>dam_ID</u>
	name
}
rectangle "built on" as bo

dam <- bo
bo -> river
```
dam(<u>dam_ID</u>, name, river_ID)
river(<u>river_ID</u>, name) {either one can work}

### Many-One
A foreign key to the "one" table is stored in the "many" table

```plantuml
allowmixing
class river{
	<u>river_ID</u>
	name
}
class stream{
	<u>stream_ID</u>
	width
}
rectangle "flows into"
stream - "flows into"
"flows into" -> river
```
stream(<u>stream_ID</u>, width, river_ID)
flows_into(<u>stream_ID</u>, river_ID)


### Many-Many
A new table is made to store the information of the relationship

```plantuml
allowmixing
class river{
	<u>river_ID</u>
	name
}
class city{
	<u>city_ID</u>
	population
}
rectangle "flows through" as ft
river - ft
ft - city
```
river(<u>stream_ID</u>, name)
city(<u>city_ID</u>, population)
flows_through(<u>river_ID</u>, <u>city_ID</u>)
