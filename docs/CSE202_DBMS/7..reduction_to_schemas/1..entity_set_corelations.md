# Entity Set Corelations
### Specialisation
#### Minimal Approach
```plantuml
allowmixing
class feline{
	fur_colour
}
class cat{
	meowing_pitch
}
class leopard{
	teeth_sharpness
}

feline <|-- leopard
feline <|-- cat
```
feline(ID, fur_colour)
cat(ID, meowing_pitch)
leopard(ID, teeth_sharpness)

The ID gives us access to the fur colour attribute of each feline. Two objects exist for each feline, the child class and the parent class

### Normalised Approach
```plantuml
allowmixing
class cat{
	meowing_pitch
}

together {
	class wet_cat{
		dampness_constant
	}
	class spotted_cat{
		spots_size
	}
}

cat <|-- wet_cat
(cat, wet_cat) -- spotted_cat
```

cat(ID, meowing_pitch)
wet_cat(ID, meowing_pitch, dampness_constant)
spotted_cat(ID, meowing_pitch, spots_size)

This layout gives us access to all needed attributes directly. But imagine the case in which a cat is both a wet cat and a spotted cat. In a situation like this, we see redundancy. The attribute meowing_pitch is defined for both wet_cat and spotted_cat, but only needs to be used once.

### Aggregation
```plantuml
allowmixing
package "" as th{
	class writer{
	}
	class guide{
	}
	class reviewer{
	}

	rectangle participate_in

	writer - participate_in
	guide -- participate_in
	participate_in - reviewer
}

rectangle is_given
th -- is_given
is_given - remarks
```

Here, is_given has the schema

is_given(<u>writer_id</u>, <u>guide_ID</u>, remarks)
