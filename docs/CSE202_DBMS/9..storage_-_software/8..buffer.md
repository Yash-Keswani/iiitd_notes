# Buffer
A buffer is the potrtion of the main memory designated to store copies of disk blocks. This reduces the number of average calls sent to the disk to fetch data.

## Buffer Manager
This is the subsystem that demarcates the buffer space in the main memory.
* when a block is needed from the disk, a request is sent to the buffer manager
* the buffer manager behaves as a cache, and returns an address from within the buffer

## Rearrangement
The OS or buffer manager can reorder writes to keep consistency in check, depending upon how the data structure is stored

## Pinned Block
A pinned block cannot be written back to the disk. A block is pinned when work is started on the block, and unpinned when this work is  done. This helps in maintaining concurrency.

## Buffer Locks
A reader gets a shared lock, while a writer gets an exclusive lock. This means that many readers can read simultaneously, but no writer can write as long as even one reader is reading. When a writer is writing, no one can read.
