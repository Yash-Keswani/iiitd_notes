# Fixed-length Records
### Assumptions
* Each record fits within some fixed size.
* Each cell of each record fits within the column width.

Records are stored next to each other in the memory. Some padding may be used to prevent records from spreading over block boundaries.

## Deletion Approaches
* Move all records below the row upwards to fill up the space.
* Move the last record to fill up the space.
* Keep a list of all free rows, which is ready to be filled whenever a new row has to be added.
