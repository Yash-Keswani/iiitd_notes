# Column-oriented Storage
## Column-Oriented Storage
A.k.a. columnar representation. Each attribute of a relation is stored separately.

### Benefits
* Reduced IO if a limited number of attributes are accessed
* Better CPU cache performance and compression
* Good for vector processing

### Costs
* Tuple reconstruction from the columnar representation
* Tuple deletion and update
* Decompression

We typically prefer row-oriented representation for transaction processing. Some databases support both styles though, and they're called hybrid row/column stores.

When stored in memory, there's an indirection table that links each column's head to a pointer.
