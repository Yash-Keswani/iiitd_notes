# Clustering And Partitioning
## Multitable Clustering
Multitable clustering is great for storing tables that are often joined with each other. In a cluster, tables records are stored interleaved with each other.

| dept_name | building | budget |
| --------- | -------- | ------ |
| CSE       | Taylor   | 100000 |
| PHY       | Watson   | 70000  |

| ID  | name   | dept_name | salary |
| --- | ------ | --------- | ------ |
| 100 | Hector | CSE       | 65000  |
| 101 | Robin  | PHY       | 57000  |
| 102 | Seth   | CSE       | 58000  |
| 103 | Genny  | CSE       | 70000  |

These two tables will be merged into the cluster

| __  | __     | __     | __    |
| --- | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| CSE | Taylor | 100000 |       |
| 100 | Hector | CSE    | 65000 |
| 102 | Seth   | CSE    | 58000 |
| 103 | Genny  | CSE    | 70000 |
| PHY | Watson | 70000  |       |
| 101 | Robin  | PHY    | 57000 | 

This won't work very well when you're querying for only one table, but makes joins faster. This is stored in variable-length records

## Partitioning
In partitioning, a single table $X$ is broken into multiple tables $\{X_i\}$ . Each table $X_i$ can be stored separately. 
* This reduces cost of some operations like free space management.
* It allows different partitions to be stored on different devices, like storing more important partitions on an SSD and less important ones on a magnetic disk.
