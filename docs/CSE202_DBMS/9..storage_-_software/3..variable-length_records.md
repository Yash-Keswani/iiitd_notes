# Variable-length Records
## Variable Length Records
* These occur in databases in several ways. The data fields might be heterogenous, and there may be variations of size between even the same datatype.
* Attributes are still stored in order.

## Slotted Page Structure
* In this structure, there are two segments - the header and the records. 
* The header tells us about a record as a (offset, length) tuple.
* Records may be rearranged to ensure they are contiguous with minimal empty space between them. The header will be rearranged according to this. 
* A pointer to the entry will not point to a record, but its header.
* The end of the header section has a single number, which tells the amount of free space in the block.
