# Sequential File Organisation
Each record is stored next to each other, in order of the primary key value. It is, in a sense, a linked list.

## Deletion
Deletion is performed as done in a linked list.

## Insertion
* If there is a free space, it is inserted there.
* If there is no free space, an overflow block is added in the middle.
* To restore sequentiality, some rearrangement time may be needed.
