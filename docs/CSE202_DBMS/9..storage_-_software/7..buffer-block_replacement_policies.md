# Buffer-block Replacement Policies
similar to cache replacement policies

## LRU
* replace the block that was used last
* the past is a predictor of the future
* can be really bad sometimes

```
for each tuple tr of r:
	for each tuple ts of s:
		if ts == tr:
			do something
```

Typically, a mixed strategy with some hints on replacement is provided by the query optimiser

## Toss-Immediate
done with a block? get rid of it.

## MRU
Keep track of the most recently used block. When the buffer is full, get rid of it.

## Speculation
The buffer manager may speculate the next request by looking at usage statistics. It may pre-emptively store that block in the buffer.
